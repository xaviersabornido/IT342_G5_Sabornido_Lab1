# 🧾 TASK CHECKLIST

## Objective
Design the system flow for User Registration, Login, and Logout. This activity focuses only on documentation and diagrams. Coding will be done next week during the face-to-face session.

## Scenario
Design a system where:
- A user can register an account
- A user can log in
- A logged-in user can view their profile/dashboard
- A user can log out
- Protected pages cannot be accessed when logged out
